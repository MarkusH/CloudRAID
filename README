Requirements
------------

HSQLDB ( http://hsqldb.org/ ) is the standard database system for the backend.
CloudRAID is tested with HSQLDB 2.2.7.
Therefore HSQLDB is required as long as no other wrapper for another database system is used.
(If you want to use another database, look at de.dhbw.mannheim.cloudraid.persistence.DatabaseConnector.)

You will also need to get the _modified_ versions of the libs scribe-java and JSON-java.
You can get them here: https://github.com/Markush2010/scribe-java and https://github.com/Markush2010/JSON-java

For testing you need JUnit 4.


----------------
Native Libraries
----------------

For performance reasons crucial parts of the application are not written in Java but in C.
The C source code is located in src/native.

To build the shared objects change to the native source folder and execute:
make clean (optional)
make
sudo make install

If you want to build a debug version of the libraries, execute:
make clean (optional)
make DEBUG=1
sudo make install

Testing the C code:
make clean (optional)
make test (optional DEBUG=1)
make run-test
